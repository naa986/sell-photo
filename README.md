When a user clicks on the Buy Now button, they will be taken to the payment page where they can pay instantly using a credit card or their PayPal account. It was developed by [noorsplugin](https://noorsplugin.com/) and is currently being used on hundreds of websites.

All you need to do is add a "sell_photo" parameter so the plugin can create a Buy button for each photo of that particular gallery.
```
[gallery link="file" ids="687,688,689,690,691,692" sell_photo="1"]
